# About alpha_omega gem

The alpha_omega gem is a fork of capistrano's 2.5.21 deploy recipes.  It
works with a forked toolchain of capistrano and a git mixin (ao-helper).

Originally just a Capfile that got cut-n-pasted to other projects,
alpha_omega became a gem for code reuse and integration with external
systems like chef and jenkins.
